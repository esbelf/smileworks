        If you are one of the many people who avoid the dentist due to anxiety, sedation dentistry is the perfect option for you. With minimal sedation, we can make you comfortable and take care of your dental issues. Even if it&rsquo;s just a simple cleaning, we want you to be anxiety-free and relaxed. Your comfort is important to us, which is why <strong>there is never a charge for nitrous oxide in our office. </strong>You can learn more about our sedation options by reading below or booking a visit.</p>

          Nitrous Oxide Sedation</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/sedation-dentistry-2.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Nitrous oxide sedation is mild and suited for patients with low anxiety. By applying nitrous oxide (i.e., &ldquo;laughing gas&rdquo;) through a nose mask, it helps you stay calm during care. Our team can then proceed smoothly and easily with your treatment. As a bonus, you can also resume everyday activities right after the procedure; nitrous oxide&rsquo;s effects quickly fade once you stop breathing it.</p>

        <h2>
          Oral Conscious Sedation</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/sedation-dentistry-3.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Compared to nitrous oxide, oral conscious sedation is stronger and works well for moderate anxiety. It usually involves taking a sedative pill before your visit and creates a state of deep relaxation. You&rsquo;ll still be awake and lucid during your treatment, you&rsquo;ll just feel groggy for a few hours afterward. Those effects are why you&rsquo;ll need someone to drive you to and from our office.</p>
