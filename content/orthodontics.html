          How Invisalign Works</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/invisalign-clear-aligners-2.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          All the patient has to do is wear a progressive series of clear aligners that fit over the teeth. They will be designed based on a highly detailed scan of the mouth, and each one is uniquely shaped to gently push the teeth into the correct positions. After wearing one set for 20-22 hours a day for a week or two, a patient simply moves on to the next set.</p>

          The Benefits of Invisalign Clear Aligners</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/invisalign-clear-aligners-3.webp" alt=""></div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Subtle: Everyone can tell when someone has braces, but Invisalign practically disappears when worn.</li>
          <li>
            Comfort: The smooth plastic of the trays is much gentler on the gums, lips, and cheeks compared to regular braces.</li>
          <li>
            Convenient: You can take the trays off to eat or brush your teeth, meaning maintaining your regular diet and oral hygiene routine is easy.</li>
        </ul>
