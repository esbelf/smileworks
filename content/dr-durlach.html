        Dr. Durlach says that her goal each day is to earn the trust of her patients with expertise and compassion, building lasting relationships that will stand the test of time. She truly believes that great dentistry starts with a great connection between the doctor and patient, and she loves getting to know people beyond their teeth so they feel right at home in our practice.</p>

        <h2>
          Why Did You Decide to Become a Dentist?</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/meet-dr-durlach-2.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          After earning a degree in Architectural History from the University of Maryland Washington and working in the field for several years, Dr. Durlach decided to pursue a career offering more human interaction and better work-life balance. Dentistry allows for both, and she has now been a part of the field since 2007.</p>
        <h2>
          Where Did You Study Dentistry?</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/meet-dr-durlach-3.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Dr. Durlach earned her dental degree from the Temple University School of Dentistry after obtaining her bachelor&rsquo;s degree from Mary Washington College.</p>
        <p>
          Dr. Durlach has focused her postgraduate education on restorative dentistry, with recent training in esthetic case design using direct composite bonding. This allows her to offer her patients affordable, long-lasting, functional restorations that conserve tooth structure and look great. Her commitment to lifelong education means she is constantly evaluating emerging dental methods and technologies to provide her patients with the best results in the least invasive manner with a high emphasis on comfort.</p>
