          Kids Dental Checkups &amp; Cleanings</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/children-dentistry-2.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Just like we do with adults, we see kids for routine visits every six months or so. These sessions include a standard oral exam and skillful teeth cleaning, ensuring we can diagnose (and treat) your child&rsquo;s dental issues. Our team also ends each visit with a few tips on brushing and flossing at home. That way, your child has what they need to maintain a strong and vibrant smile through their younger years.</p>

          Athletic Mouthguards/ Sportsguards</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/children-dentistry-3.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          If your child likes to play contact sports, you may want to invest in our custom sportsguards. The truth is that sporting events put players at risk of dental injuries &ndash; chips, cracks, knocked-out teeth, and more. Our athletic mouthguards could prevent such things, helping your child&rsquo;s smile stay safe during games.</p>

          Dental Sealants</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/children-dentistry-4.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Even careful brushing and flossing may not clean your child&rsquo;s teeth thoroughly enough to protect them from tooth decay. Unfortunately, even the smallest cavity causes permanent damage that needs treatment like a filling or crown. The good news is that there is a quick and easy way to help prevent cavities: dental sealants!</p>
        <p>
          These are applied when a patient is still in his or her formative years, and they are completely painless, taking just minutes to place. This treatment is one of the best techniques for both children and adolescents to preserve their teeth throughout their lives.</p>

        <h2>
          Silver Diamine Treatment</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/children-dentistry-5.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Instead of fluoride alone, we often provide child patients with a silver diamine treatment. This procedure uses a special liquid to kill bad oral bacteria and re-mineralize enamel. In other words, it slows down tooth decay and stops a child&rsquo;s cavities from getting worse. Best of all, the treatment is pain-free &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t require the use of drills, injections, or similar things.</p>

          Pulp Treatment</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/children-dentistry-6.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Tooth infections aren&rsquo;t just for adults; kids can also get them. In those cases, we suggest what&rsquo;s called a pulp treatment &ndash; the removal of the infected pulp. This service addresses your child&rsquo;s infection and rebuilds their tooth to make it stable (until it falls out naturally). That said, the treatment can vary a bit based on your child&rsquo;s situation. Whether it removes part or all of a tooth&rsquo;s pulp will depend on the case.</p>
