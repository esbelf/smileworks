        <h2>
          Why Did You Decide to Become a Dentist?</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/meet-dr-herbert-2.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Dr. Herbert knew she wanted to be a dentist since she was a child. As a baby, a fall required her to make many dental visits, and she always left feeling better and wanted to be able to help others in the same way. Combined with her passion for art and science, dentistry ended up being the perfect profession for her.</p>
        <h2>
          Where Did You Study Dentistry?</h2>

          Dr. Herbert graduated from the College of Charleston before obtaining her DMD from the Medical University of South Carolina. She went on to earn her PhD in molecular and cell biology and currently serves as the President of the South Carolina Academy of General Dentistry. She also stays on top of the latest breakthroughs in her field thanks to her memberships in the American Dental Association, South Carolina Dental Association, and the Academy of General Dentistry.</p>

        <p>
          Most of Dr. Herbert&rsquo;s time away from dentistry is dedicated to her husband, their baby boy, and two cats. She likes to stay active, practicing yoga, hiking, and sailing whenever she can. To relax, you&rsquo;ll often find her painting or planning a trip to see family.</p>
