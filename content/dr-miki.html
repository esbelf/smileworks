        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/meet-dr-miki-2.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Dr. Miki knew she wanted to become a dentist during high school after undergoing braces, which dramatically changed her smile and boosted her self-confidence. That experience, combined with volunteering at a dental clinic, showed her how transformative dental care can be. She was drawn to the mix of science, hands-on work, and the opportunity to help others feel better about their teeth and overall health.</p>
