        As crucial as they are, daily brushing and flossing aren&rsquo;t enough to fully protect your smile. Oral care at home often overlooks things and can&rsquo;t reach all the parts of your mouth. That&rsquo;s why Smileworks helps out with preventive dentistry here in Mt. Pleasant! By looking after your teeth and gums, our dentists ensure your grin stays as healthy as ever. Learn more about this preventive work by reading below or schedule a checkup and cleaning by <a href="contact.html">clicking here</a>.</p>

        <p>
          We want you to stay healthy, and having your teeth cleaned by our licensed, professional hygienist is a very important step toward that goal.</p>
        <p>
          Plaque forms on your teeth over time &ndash; even with the most meticulous daily care. Once it hardens into tartar, regular brushing and flossing will not remove it. By keeping up with regular visits with your hygienist, we can keep any issues at bay and help you maintain your dental hygiene.</p>

          Gum Disease Treatment</h2>

        <p>
          Should your gums become infected, we&rsquo;ll strongly suggest gum disease treatment. This procedure mainly relies on scaling and root planing &ndash; a &ldquo;deep cleaning&rdquo; that targets plaque and tartar beneath your gum line. If that&rsquo;s not enough, our team can also give you an antibiotic for good measure. This extra step directly kills the bacteria behind your infection, helping your gums heal and recover.</p>

          Nightguards for Bruxism</h2>

          <img alt="" src="/images/preventive-dentistry-4.webp" /></div>
        <p>
          Teeth grinding (called bruxism) can cause teeth, fillings, and crowns to wear down, break, or even become non-restorable (leading to tooth loss). Bruxism can also lead to migraine headaches and severe TMJ issues.</p>
        <p>
          Most commonly done while you are sleeping, you may be unaware of this habit. If you have noticed regular headaches, jaw pain or soreness, or have broken or chipped teeth recently, you may be grinding your teeth in your sleep. Fortunately, we can help! With a custom-made nightguard, we can help protect your smile throughout the night.</p>

          Oral Cancer Screenings</h2>
        <div class="elem">
          <img alt="" src="/images/preventive-dentistry-5.webp" /></div>
        <p>
          Aside from everything else, our office also does an oral cancer screening at each dental checkup. This step closely looks at your mouth for relevant signs of cancer &ndash; sores, growths, discolored tissue, etc. To that extent, it makes early diagnosis more likely and lets you deal with oral cancer (if present) in the initial stages. The results are higher odds of treatment success and a shorter recovery time, making things easier for everyone.</p>

          <img alt="" src="/images/preventive-dentistry-6.webp" /></div>
        <p>
          Based on your needs, we may add a fluoride treatment to the end of your dental checkup. This option puts a fluoridated gel on your teeth after they&rsquo;re cleaned and polished. The gel has more fluoride than toothpaste or tap water, greatly enhancing your enamel and reducing the risk of cavities. It should protect your smile from harmful bacteria until your next routine visit, and applying it is both painless and quick!</p>
