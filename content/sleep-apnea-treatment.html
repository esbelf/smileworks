          What Is Sleep Apnea?</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/sleep-apnea-treatment-2.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Sleep apnea is a disorder that stops your breathing while asleep, preventing proper nighttime rest. This stoppage tends to result in symptoms like loud snoring, insomnia, daytime fatigue, and irritability. When it&#39;s left unchecked, it can even cause severe health complications.</p>
        <p>
          There are two main types of sleep apnea, each with its own causes. The more common one is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which occurs when throat muscles block your airway. Meanwhile, central sleep apnea (CSA) happens when your brain doesn&rsquo;t send the signals needed to breathe.</p>

          How We Treat Sleep Apnea</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/sleep-apnea-treatment-3.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          A typical treatment for sleep apnea is CPAP therapy, but many patients don&#39;t like this option. That&rsquo;s why our office offers something different: oral appliance treatment.</p>
        <p>
          By wearing one of our custom-made EMA Snore Guards, your lower jaw is slightly shifted so your airway stays open all night. The result is a drastic reduction of sleep apnea symptoms, so much so that 90% of patients see major improvements.</p>
