        Dr. Connar has been with Smileworks for over a decade, and she says that nothing is more satisfying than helping a patient by addressing the root cause of their problem. She enjoys educating people about their oral health, making it clear what their options are, and then delivering personalized care so they can smile <em>with </em>confidence and <em>without </em>discomfort.</p>

          Why Did You Decide to Become a Dentist?</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/meet-dr-connar-2.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Dr. Connar first became interested in dentistry when she saw how a person&rsquo;s smile could impact their self-esteem. Her fascination naturally grew as she discovered the connection between dental health and overall health, seeing that dentistry could do much, much more than just give someone great looking teeth.</p>
        <h2>
          Where Did You Study Dentistry?</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/meet-dr-connar-3.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Dr. Connar attended The Ohio State University before going on to earn her dental degree from the Medical University of South Carolina. She has experience treating patients of all ages, having spent a couple of years focused on pediatric dentistry before finding her home in general dentistry.</p>
        <p>
          Dr. Connar has completed many courses through Spear Education in areas such as preventative care, airway health, sleep medicine, Invisalign, Botox for TMJ, and orofacial pain.
