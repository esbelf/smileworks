          What Is Gum Disease?</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/gum-disease-treatment-2.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Gum disease is an infection of the tissues around your teeth, often caused by a buildup of plaque &ndash; a sticky film of bacteria. That film creates toxins when it isn&rsquo;t quickly removed (by brushing, flossing, etc.), damaging your gums in the process. It can then trigger an infection below your gum line and do a lot of damage. In some advanced cases, gum disease will even result in tooth loss, jawbone loss, and more.</p>

          Symptoms of Gum Disease</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/gum-disease-treatment-3.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Since gum disease has two stages, it can have a wide range of symptoms. Make sure to keep an eye out for the following signs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Gums that bleed easily</li>
          <li>
            Red, swollen, tender gums</li>
          <li>
            Gums that have pulled away from the teeth</li>
          <li>
            Persistent bad breath or bad taste</li>
          <li>
            Pus between your teeth and gums</li>
          <li>
            Permanent teeth that are loose or separating</li>
          <li>
            Any change in the way your teeth fit together when you bite</li>
          <li>
            Any change in the fit of partial dentures<br />
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p> <a name="scale"></a></p>
        <h2>
          Scaling &amp; Root Planing</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/gum-disease-treatment-4.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          This procedure acts as a two-step &ldquo;deep cleaning&rdquo; that targets the harmful bacteria beneath your gum line. The scaling removes plaque from your teeth (including the roots), while the root planing smooths out the dental roots. This second step is especially helpful, as it promotes healthy gum reattachment and jumpstarts the healing process; it also reduces the risk of re-infection.</p>
        <p>
          <a name="anti"></a></p>
        <h2>
          Antibiotic Treatment</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/gum-disease-treatment-5.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          If your gum disease is severe, we suggest you get antibiotic treatment after scaling and root planing. This extra option would have you take antibiotics to fight off your infection. By specifically targeting harmful bacteria, its medicines should reduce your gum pockets after just a few weeks or so.</p>
