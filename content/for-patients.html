        We love welcoming new patients through our doors and helping them feel right at home, but you probably have a few questions first! Below, you&rsquo;ll find information about what will happen during your initial visit as well as our payment options. If there is anything else you&rsquo;d like to know, you can always reach out to our team.</p>

          You can expect your first cleaning and exam appointment to take about two hours. We understand this is longer compared to other offices, but this is because we want to truly get to know you as a person while fully understanding your oral health. This also gives us plenty of time to capture images, go over them with you, and discuss future treatment options in detail so you walk out of our office with complete certainty.</p>
