        Our commitment to using the latest technology has been a core part of our practice philosophy from the day we opened. We only use the latest, proven instruments because they lead to more precise care, more transparency for you, as well as more comfort in the chair. As technology improves, you can trust our practice to keep pace!</p>

          DIAGNOdent Cavity Detection</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/dental-technology-2.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Rather than just poking your teeth to search for cavities, we can shine a special light on the enamel. This will indicate the smallest signs of decay or thinning, allowing us to intervene as soon as possible and prevent many cavities from developing in the first place!</p>
        <h2>
          The Wand</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/dental-technology-3.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          This device makes it possible to receive local anesthetic without having to deal with the &ldquo;pinch&rdquo; that often accompanies the injection. The Wand administers the anesthetic so slowly and evenly that your body won&rsquo;t register the sensation, meaning you essentially feel nothing before you actually feel nothing during your procedure.</p>
        <h2>
          iTero Intraoral Scanner</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/dental-technology-4.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          If a patient needs a crown, veneer, or denture, we always take an impression of their teeth and bite first so we can make sure their restoration looks and fits perfectly. Instead of relying on a physical mold, we can simply scan the mouth and produce a perfect digital recreation in a matter of minutes, which we can instantly send to our lab.</p>
        <h2>
          Digital Shade Matching</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/dental-technology-5.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          We use Easyshade technology for color-matching, meaning that when you get a veneer, bonding, or even whitening from us, you can trust the results will blend in perfectly with your natural teeth.</p>
        <h2>
          Pearl Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/dental-technology-6.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Pearl AI is able to evaluate dental imaging and detect all kinds of potential issues, essentially giving our dentists a second set of eyes that enable them to be even more proactive. This makes it easier to provide more care in less time as well as stay ahead of the most common issues.</p>
