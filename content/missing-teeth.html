        As you may have guessed, life gets tricky when you lose teeth. Just lacking one or two can make many daily tasks &ndash; eating, speaking, smiling, etc. &ndash; much harder. What&rsquo;s worse is that tooth loss also harms your oral health, putting your mouth at risk. Smileworks takes the problem of missing teeth in Mt. Pleasant seriously, which is why we offer multiple tooth-replacement options. To learn more about them, simply keep reading or schedule a visit.</p>

          Dental Bridges</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/missing-teeth-2.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Dental bridges are used to replace one to four adjoining teeth, &ldquo;bridging&rdquo; a patient&rsquo;s large gaps in the process. Since most are made of dental crowns fused to an artificial tooth, normal models rely on nearby natural teeth for support. However, an implant bridge avoids this by using dental implants to anchor the restoration in place.</p>

          Dental Implants</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/missing-teeth-3.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Unlike bridges or removable dentures, which sit on top of the gums, implants are surgically placed under the gums. The titanium post acts as the new root structure to replace the missing tooth. Once the area has healed, a beautiful natural-looking crown is then placed to restore your smile and full functionality. Dental implants can also be used to anchor dentures, making the problems of slipping and movement a thing of the past.</p>

          Patients with severe tooth loss would benefit most from our dentures, as they can restore many teeth at once. Which kind you get will depend on your unique needs. Partial dentures would let you replace a few teeth, while full ones could sit on your gum line and restore a whole arch. If you&rsquo;d like, our team could even fit your dentures with dental implants; they&rsquo;d make your appliance extremely secure and stable.</p>
