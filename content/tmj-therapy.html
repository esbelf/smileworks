          What Is TMJ Disorder?</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/tmj-treatment-2.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          TMJ refers to your temporomandibular joints &ndash; the tiny hinges connecting your jaw to your skull. TMJ disorders are problems with said hinges and the facial muscles that control them.</p>
        <p>
          Most TMJ disorders cause a range of unpleasant symptoms:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Jaw pain</li>
          <li>
            Facial pain</li>
          <li>
            Stiffness in the jaw</li>
          <li>
            Jaw popping or clicking</li>
          <li>
            Headaches or migraines</li>
          <li>
            Pain when chewing or biting<br />
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
          How We Treat TMJ Disorder</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/tmj-treatment-3.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Depending on your disorder&rsquo;s cause, we&rsquo;ll provide you with an equilibration or an occlusal splint.</p>
        <p>
          An equilibration (or occlusal adjustment) helps when the TMJ has an alignment issue. For this treatment, our dentists slightly reshape a few teeth so the top and bottom arches fit together better. Such changes would reduce the pressure on your TMJ.</p>
        <p>
          If the disorder stems from bruxism or teeth grinding, we&rsquo;ll give you an occlusal splint. This device reduces muscle tension in your face, lessening the pressure on your jaw joints.</p>
        <p>
          (You&rsquo;ll only wear the splint at night.)</p>
        <p>
          <a name="inject"></a></p>
        <h2>
          BOTOX Injections for TMJ Disorder</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/tmj-treatment-4.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          For patients in need of immediate relief from TMJ-related pain, we can strategically inject Botox into overactive and overworked jaw muscles, making them relax. This effect comes on quickly and will last for months on end, during which our team can apply a more long-term solution so that the problem doesn&rsquo;t come back.</p>
