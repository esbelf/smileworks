          Tooth-Colored Fillings</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/restorative-dentistry-2.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          These blends of resin &ldquo;fill&rdquo; the holes left by any minor decay, all while matching the shade of your smile. You can trust them to protect and beautify your grin in ways older metal fillings can&rsquo;t. Getting them is also pain-free and just takes one visit, so we can quickly make your tooth (or teeth) whole and ready for the world again.</p>

          Dental Crowns</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/restorative-dentistry-3.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Unlike fillings, our dental crowns are small, durable caps fitted over weak teeth. Placing one protects an underlying tooth from further decay and damage, making your smile stronger. Each crown also matches your other teeth in color, size, and position, so they&rsquo;ll blend seamlessly and look natural. You can even choose their material &ndash; Emax, zirconia, or porcelain &ndash; to ensure the best results.</p>

        <p>
          If you&rsquo;re facing many restorative and cosmetic issues, you should opt for a full mouth reconstruction. This service consists of many procedures that rebuild your teeth and gums, so it&#39;s very comprehensive. The included options can range from simple teeth whitening and veneers to more involved dental bridges or implants. As for which procedures are involved, that&rsquo;ll depend on your needs and your custom treatment plan. The final reconstruction&rsquo;s effects should be the same, regardless &ndash; a robust and attractive smile!</p>
