        As great as dentures and dental bridges are, dental implants stand above. These restorations replace whole teeth instead of just the crowns, providing beautiful and lifelike results that can be trusted to last for decades. For more details on dental implants, please keep reading or see us for a consultation.</p>

          What Are Dental Implants?</h2>
        <div class="elem"><img src="/images/dental-implants-2.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Dental implants are tooth-sized posts made of titanium. Their design lets them act as alternative tooth roots for missing teeth.</p>
        <p>
          Dental implants work through a unique placement method. Dentists set them in your jaw&rsquo;s empty sockets (rather than on your gums) to fuse with nearby bone tissue. Once that&rsquo;s done, the implant posts meld with (and stimulate the growth of) nearby bone tissue and become parts of your jaw.</p>

          The 4-Step Dental Implant Process</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Initial Dental Implant Consultation</strong> &ndash; You&rsquo;ll first consult with one of our dentists before you undergo treatment. That way, we can learn about your oral health and smile goals to see if implants would be a good fit for you.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dental Implant Surgery</strong> &ndash; If you decide to proceed, we&rsquo;ll refer you to a local specialist for your dental implant surgery.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dental Implant Osseointegration/Abutment</strong> &ndash; Once your dental implants fuse with your jaw, we&rsquo;ll place their abutments (i.e., metal connectors).</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Delivery of Dental Implant Restoration(s)</strong> &ndash; After your mouth has fully healed, you&rsquo;ll see us so we can attach your final restoration. This item could be a dental crown, bridge, or denture.</li>
        </ul>
